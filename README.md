# new-sentiment-analyzer
This sentiment analyzer for news is built on a BERT-based deep learning model. It is designed to analyze the sentiment expressed in news articles, helping users understand the emotional tone conveyed in the text.

## Model Details

- **Architecture:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Files:**
  - `config.json`: Configuration file for the BERT model.
  - `model_weights.h5`: Model weights file.
  - `model_saved_model/`: TensorFlow SavedModel format for easy integration.
  
## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Loading the Model:**
   ```python
   from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification

   tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('your-username/your-model-name')
   model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('your-username/your-model-name')
   ```

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   ```python
   text = "Your news article goes here."
   inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
   outputs = model(**inputs)
   predictions = outputs.logits
   sentiment_label = "Positive" if predictions.argmax() == 1 else "Negative"
   print(f"Predicted Sentiment: {sentiment_label}")
   ```

## Example

```python
text = "Innovative tech solutions drive positive changes in the industry."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
predictions = outputs.logits
sentiment_label = "Positive" if predictions.argmax() == 1 else "Negative"
print(f"Predicted Sentiment: {sentiment_label}")
```
